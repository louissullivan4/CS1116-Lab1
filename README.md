Lengths HTML and PY:
  Write a server-side Python program in a file called lengths.py. 
  The program receives the user's data from the form, and converts the number to the other units. It outputs 
  all three values in a Web page that contains an HTML table.
  
Spies HTML and Py:
  The program outputs a Web page that greets the user in 007-fashion. For example, 
  if the user enters 'James' and 'Bond', the Web page will contain the following paragraph:
                Your spy name is: Bond, James Bond.
